# hw3-passwordgenerator
This project is a designated assignment for the Univesity of Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.  The objective is to create an application that will generate a random password based on user-selected criteria.  
The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

-Upon initialization of the app by clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user will be prompted for the length of the intended password.  The code ensures the password can only contain at minimum 8 characters and at maximum, 128 character. If the user selects an answer outside of this range, they will receive an alert about the alloted size and will be promted to start again.  
-The user will now be directed through four seperate confirms.  The first for a capital letter, the second for a lowercase letter, the third for a numerical character and the final for a symbol. Each character is mandatory for the completion of the password and if any are not confirmed, the user is alerted that each is mandatory and to begin the character selection again.
-Once all four confirms' conditions have been met, a password output will generate in the designated text box.
